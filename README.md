# Sprint 1_List_Reverse_Project

📄 **Description - Exercise Statement**

This project involves creating and populating a `List<Integer>`. A second `List<Integer>` will be created, and the elements of the first list will be inserted into the second list in reverse order. The project demonstrates the use of `ListIterator` objects to read elements from the first list and insert them into the second.

The first step is to define and populate the first `List<Integer>`. Then, a `ListIterator` will be used to traverse the first list in reverse and insert the elements into the second list.
